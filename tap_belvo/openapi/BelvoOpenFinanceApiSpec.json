    "description": "# Introduction\n\nBelvo is an open banking API for Latin America that allows companies to access banking and fiscal information in a secure as well as agile way.\n\nThrough our API, you can access:\n\n\n- **Bank information** such as account information, real-time\nbalance, historical transactions, and account owner identification.\n\n- **Fiscal information** such as received and sent invoices and tax returns.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://files.readme.io/acf27d3-belvo_pipes.png\"\nalt=\"fiscal-endpoints\">\n\n\nIn this API reference you'll find all the information you need about each\n\nendpoint and resource.\n\n\n<div style=\"background-color:#f4f6f8; border-left: 6px solid\n#4CAF50;padding: 12px;margin-left: 25px; border-radius: 4px; margin-right:\n25px\">\n\n<strong>Tip: </strong> Make sure that you also check out our Developer\nPortal for guides on <a\nhref=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/get-started-in-5-minutes\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">how to get started</a>, using our <a\nhref=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/test-in-sandbox\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">Sandbox environment</a>, as well as how to <a\nhref=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/connect-widget\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">integrate the widget</a> or use our <a\nhref=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/quickstart-application\"\ntarget=\"_blank\">quickstart application</a>.\n\n</div>\n\n\n## Environment\n\nWe currently offer three environments: sandbox, development, and\nproduction.\n\n\nWhen using our SDKs, make sure to use the **Alias** (and not the Base URL).\n\n\n| Environment | Purpose | Access |\n|-----------|-------|-------|\n| **Sandbox** | The [Sandbox environment](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/test-in-sandbox) is dedicated for your testing and development phases. In this environment, you can create links without real credentials and you can pull test data from all endpoints. **⚠️The sandbox environment is refreshed frequently and your test data can be updated or deleted.** | Base URL (cURL): https://sandbox.belvo.com/ <br><br>Alias (SDKs): sandbox|\n|**Development**|The Development environment is dedicated for testing with real credentials and institutions with real-world institutions. You can create up to 25 links for free in this environment.| Base URL (cURL): https://development.belvo.com/ <br><br>Alias (SDKs): development |\n| **Production** | The Production environment is dedicated for live applications with real connections to institutions. In this environment, you\nwill need real credentials to create links and you will pull real data from the institutions.| Base URL (cURL): https://api.belvo.com/ <br><br>Alias\n(SDKs): production|\n\n\nFor each environment, you'll need to [generate separate API\nkeys](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/get-your-belvo-api-keys).\n\n\n## Response codes\n\n\nWe use the following HTTP status code in the response depending on the\nsuccess or failure:\n\n\n| Status Code | Description |\n|-----------|-------|\n| `200` | ✅ **Success** - The content is available in the response body. |\n| `201` | ✅ **Success** - The content was created successfully on Belvo. |\n| `204` | ✅ **Success** - No content to return. |\n| `400` | ❌ **Bad Request Error** - Request returned an error, detail in content.|\n| `401` | ❌ **Unauthorized** - The Belvo credentials provided are not valid.|\n| `404` | ❌ **Not Found** - The resource you try to access cannot be found.|\n| `405` | ❌ **Method Not Allowed** - The HTTP method you are using is not accepted for this resource.|\n| `408` | ❌ **Request Timeout** - The request timed out and was terminated by the server.|\n| `428` | ❌ **MFA Token Required** - MFA token was required by the institution to connect. |\n| `500` | ❌ **Internal Server Error** - The detail of the error is available in the response body.|\n\n\n## Error handling\n\n\n### Error messages\n\n\nBelvo API errors are returned in JSON format. For example, an error might\nlook like this:\n\n\n```json\n\n[\n    {\n      \"request_id\": \"a6e1c493d7a29d91aed4338e6fcf077d\",\n      \"message\": \"This field is required.\",\n      \"code\": \"required\",\n      \"field\": \"link\"\n    }\n]\n\n```\n\n\nTypically, an error response will have the following parameters:\n\n- `request_id`: a unique ID for the request, you should share it with the\nBelvo support team for investigations.\n\n- `message`: human-readable description of the error.\n\n- `code`: a unique code for the error. Check the table below to see how to\nhandle each error code.\n\n- `field` *(optional)*: The specific field in the request body that has an\nissue.\n\n\n\n### Request identifier\n\nWhen you need help with a specific error, add the request identifier\n(`request_id`) in your message to the Belvo support team. This will speed up\ninvestigations and get you back up and running in no time at all.\n\n\n### Error codes and troubleshooting\n\n\nFor a full list of errors and how to troubleshoot them, please see our\ndedicated [Error handling\narticles](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/integration-overview#error-handling)\nin our DevPortal.\n\n\n\n### Retry policy\n\n\nPlease see our recommended [retry\npolicies](https://developers.belvo.com/docs/integration-overview#error-retry-policy)\nin the DevPortal.\n",

Then, when you receive the webhook, you can make GET requests to the List or Detail endpoints to instantly access up-to-date information, without needing to connect to the institution.\n\n<img src=\"https://files.readme.io/7b6c0d4-Recurrent_Link_FLow.png\" alt=\"fiscal-endpoints\" width=\"950\">\n\nYou can also make POST calls directly to the institution, as with single links, as soon as the link is created. However, we recommend you follow the flow described above (waiting for the webhook event) for a more optimal experience.\n\n### Single links\n\nSingle links are used to perform ad hoc data access to accounts, owners, transactions, and so on. For example, you can use it when you want to do an underwriting process to assess risk before lending money.\n\nFor single links, you have to perform POST calls to an institution **every time** you want to access fresh data.\n\n<img src=\"https://files.readme.io/eda7956-Single_Link_Flow.svg\" alt=\"fiscal-endpoints\" width=\"950\">"
