    "description": "# Introduction\n\nReach new audiences and convert more users by easily and safely connecting to their financial data, understanding their behavior and enabling instant payments with open finance. Through our API, you can access:\n\n## Available Information and Payment Methods\n\nBelvo is an open banking API for Latin America that allows companies to access banking and fiscal information in a secure as well as agile way.\n\nThrough our API, you can access:\n\n- Banking Information in Brazil\n- Employment Information in Brazil\n- Employment Information in Mexico\n- Fiscal Information in Mexico\n- Fiscal Information in Chile\n\nYou can also use our API to make payments in:\n\n- Brazil\n- Mexico\n\n## Data Dictionaries\n\nIf you woud like the response documentation in Excel or CSV form, please download them from our public GitHub Reposiitory: <a href=\"https://github.com/belvo-finance-opensource/documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Belvo Open Finance Data Dictionaries</a>. \n\nOur EXCEL and CSV files are additionally localized into Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil).\n\n\n## Environments\n\nWe currently offer two environments: sandbox and production.\n\n### Sandbox\n\nAvailable for:\n\n- \ud83d\udfe2 Aggregation and Enrichment\n- \u26aa\ufe0f Payment Initiation\n\nUse our Sandbox environment to build your integration. We offer dummy data that mimics that of real-world use cases, which means you can test out all the endpoints, use the widget, and implement webhooks - just as you would with real-world data!\n\nAll you need to get started with the Sandbox environment is to get your API keys. We really recommend that you start creating your integration in this environment.\n\n\n### Production\n\nAvailable for:\n\n- \ud83d\udfe2 Aggregation and Enrichment\n- \ud83d\udfe2 Payment Initiation\n\nAfter you have tested your integration in the Sandbox environment and are ready to go live, you'll need to request access to our Production environment. After you request access, our Sales Team will get in contact with you to schedule a meeting just to ensure your needs are met, and then you'll just need to go through a certification process with one of our engineers to make sure that your integration is running optimally. To prepare for the certification meeting, just follow our Integration checklist.\n\nOnce your integration is certified, all you'll need to do is:\n\n - [ ] Request Production API keys (and change your Sandbox API keys in the code to these new ones).\n - [ ] Change the base URL that you make requests to from `sandbox.belvo.com` to `api.belvo.com`.\n - [ ] If you're using webhooks, make sure to set a Production URL for your webhooks.\n\n\n\n## Response codes\n\n\nWe use the following HTTP status code in the response depending on the\nsuccess or failure:\n\n\n| Status Code | Description |\n|-----------|-------|\n| `200` | \u2705 **Success** - The content is available in the response body. |\n| `201` | \u2705 **Success** - The content was created successfully on Belvo. |\n| `204` | \u2705 **Success** - No content to return. |\n| `400` | \u274c **Bad Request Error** - Request returned an error, detail in the content.|\n| `401` | \u274c **Unauthorized** - The Belvo credentials provided are not valid.|\n| `404` | \u274c **Not Found** - The resource you try to access cannot be found.|\n| `405` | \u274c **Method Not Allowed** - The HTTP method you are using is not accepted for this resource.|\n| `408` | \u274c **Request Timeout** - The request timed out and was terminated by the server.|\n| `428` | \u274c **MFA Token Required** - MFA token was required by the institution to connect. |\n| `500` | \u274c **Internal Server Error** - The detail of the error is available in the response body.|\n\n\n## Error handling\n\nBelvo API errors are returned in JSON format. For example, an error might look like this:\n\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n      \"request_id\": \"a6e1c493d7a29d91aed4338e6fcf077d\",\n      \"message\": \"This field is required.\",\n      \"code\": \"required\",\n      \"field\": \"link\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n\nTypically, an error response will have the following parameters:\n\n- `request_id`: a unique ID for the request, you should share it with the Belvo support team for investigations.\n- `message`: human-readable description of the error.\n- `code`: a unique code for the error. Check the table below to see how to handle each error code.\n- `field` *(optional)*: The specific field in the request body that has an issue.\n\n\n\n### Request identifier\n\nWhen you need help with a specific error, include the request identifier (`request_id`) in your message to the Belvo support team. This will speed up investigations and get you back up and running in no time at all.\n\n### Error codes and troubleshooting\n\nFor a full list of errors and how to troubleshoot them, please see our dedicated Error Handling article.\n\n### Retry policy\n\n#### 50x errors\n\nImplement an automated exponential backoff of up to five retries. We recommend using a base interval of three seconds with a factor of two. For example, the first retry should be after three seconds, the second retry after six seconds (2 * 3), the third retry after 12 seconds (2 * 6), the fourth retry after 24 seconds (2 * 12), and the fifth retry after 48 seconds (2 * 24).\n\n#### 40x errors\n\nYou should not retry making requests if you receive a 40x response, as this is a client error.\n\nThe only exception is the \u201cToo Many Sessions\u201d error, as it means that your end-user is accessing the account from another browser at the same time. In this case, please implement the same retry policy as with 50x errors.\n\n## Deprecated fields\n\nIn our schema, you may see that a field has been marked as `deprecated`. This means that this field is no longer maintained by the Belvo team. You may still receive data for this field depending on the institution, however, you should **not** rely on this field.\n\n## OpenAPI: required and nullable fields\n\nIn our API specification, you'll see that some response parameters will have a **required** annotation. According to the OpenAPI specification, when a response parameter is marked as **required**, this means that the response key must be returned. However, the value of that response parameter can be `null`.\n\n> \ud83d\udcd8 Info\n> \n> In short, any response parameter marked as required will be returned by our API, but the value can be set to null.",

Get the details of a specific `owners.id` (using the `id` query parameter).\n3. **[Not Recommended]** List all owners related to your Belvo account (without using any query parameters).\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Pagination\n\nThis method returns a paginated response (default: 100 items per page). You can use the `page_size` query parameter to increase the number of items returned to a maximum of 1000 items. You can use the `page` query parameter to navigate through the results. For more details on how to navigate Belvo's paginated responses, see our <a href=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/belvo-pagination-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Pagination Tips</a> article.\n\n## \ud83d\udd26 Filtering Responses\n\nPlease see the query list below for a list of fields that you can filter your responses by. For more information on how to use filters, see our <a href=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/searching-and-filtering\" target=\"_blank\">Filtering responses</a> article.\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Deprecated Fields\n\nThis resource may return deprecated fields. In the response documentation you may see that a field has been marked as **deprecated**. This means that this field is no longer maintained by the Belvo team. You may still receive data for this field depending on the institution, however, you should not rely on this field.\n",

List employment records related to a specific `link.id` (using the `link` query parameter).\n2. Get the details of a specific `employment-record.id` (using the `id` query parameter).\n3. **[Not Recommended]** List all employment records related to your Belvo account (without using any query parameters).\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Pagination\n\nThis method returns a paginated response (default: 100 items per page). You can use the `page_size` query parameter to increase the number of items returned to a maximum of 1000 items. You can use the `page` query parameter to navigate through the results. For more details on how to navigate Belvo's paginated responses, see our <a href=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/belvo-pagination-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Pagination Tips</a> article.\n\n## \ud83d\udd26 Filtering Responses\n\nPlease see the query list below for a list of fields that you can filter your responses by.

Get the details of a specific `risk-insight.id` (using the `id` query parameter).\n3. **[Not Recommended]** List all risk insights related to your Belvo account (without using any query parameters).\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Pagination\n\nThis method returns a paginated response (default: 100 items per page). You can use the `page_size` query parameter to increase the number of items returned to a maximum of 1000 items. You can use the `page` query parameter to navigate through the results. For more details on how to navigate Belvo's paginated responses, see our <a href=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/belvo-pagination-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Pagination Tips</a> article.\n\n## \ud83d\udd26 Filtering Responses\n\nPlease see the query list below for a list of fields that you can filter your responses by.

Get the details of a specific `invoice.id` (using the `id` query parameter).\n3. **[Not Recommended]** List all invoices related to your Belvo account (without using any query parameters).\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Pagination\n\nThis method returns a paginated response (default: 100 items per page). You can use the `page_size` query parameter to increase the number of items returned to a maximum of 1000 items. You can use the `page` query parameter to navigate through the results. For more details on how to navigate Belvo's paginated responses, see our <a href=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/belvo-pagination-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Pagination Tips</a> article.\n\n## \ud83d\udd26 Filtering Responses\n\nPlease see the query list below for a list of fields that you can filter your responses by. For more information on how to use filters, see our <a href=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/searching-and-filtering\" target=\"_blank\">Filtering responses</a> article.\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Deprecated Fields\n\nThis resource may return deprecated fields. In the response documentation you may see that a field has been marked as **deprecated**. This means that this field is no longer maintained by the Belvo team. You may still receive data for this field depending on the institution, however, you should not rely on this field.\n",

Get the details of a specific `tax-return.id` (using the `id` query parameter).\n  3. **[Not Recommended]** List all tax returns related to your Belvo account (without using any query parameters).\n\n  ## \ud83d\udcd6 Pagination\n  \n  This method returns a paginated response (default: 100 items per page). You can use the `page_size` query parameter to increase the number of items returned to a maximum of 1000 items. You can use the `page` query parameter to navigate through the results. For more details on how to navigate Belvo's paginated responses, see our <a href=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/belvo-pagination-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Pagination Tips</a> article.\n  \n  ## \ud83d\udd26 Filtering Responses\n  \n  Please see the query list below for a list of fields that you can filter your responses by. For more information on how to use filters, see our <a href=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/searching-and-filtering\" target=\"_blank\">Filtering responses</a> article.\n\n  ## \ud83d\udd14 Multiple Schemas\n\n  As a link can have both yearly and monthly tax returns, the response will include a mix of these two types of tax returns (and thus difference schemas).\n",

Get the details of a specific `tax-retention.id` (using the `id` query parameter).\n  3. **[Not Recommended]** List all tax retentions related to your Belvo account (without using any query parameters).\n\n  ## \ud83d\udcd6 Pagination\n  \n  This method returns a paginated response (default: 100 items per page). You can use the `page_size` query parameter to increase the number of items returned to a maximum of 1000 items. You can use the `page` query parameter to navigate through the results. For more details on how to navigate Belvo's paginated responses, see our <a href=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/belvo-pagination-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Pagination Tips</a> article.\n  \n  ## \ud83d\udd26 Filtering Responses\n  \n  Please see the query list below for a list of fields that you can filter your responses by.

Get the details of a specific `debt-report.id` (using the `id` query parameter).\n3. **[Not Recommended]** List all debt reports related to your Belvo account (without using any query parameters).\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Pagination\n\nThis method returns a paginated response (default: 100 items per page). You can use the `page_size` query parameter to increase the number of items returned to a maximum of 1000 items. You can use the `page` query parameter to navigate through the results. For more details on how to navigate Belvo's paginated responses, see our <a href=\"https://developers.belvo.com/docs/belvo-pagination-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Pagination Tips</a> article.\n\n## \ud83d\udd26 Filtering Responses\n\nPlease see the query list below for a list of fields that you can filter your responses by.
